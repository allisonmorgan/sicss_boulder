Ethics:
* Scraping data -> consumers (1), behaviors (2) -> what happens after? Reproducibility and disclosure
   * Public, private, varying levels of access?
* Nature of the data: convenience vs validity; poor data quality; sampling
   * What happens to deleted tweets?
   * Algorithms for filtering privilege some tweets
* WWI soldiers are all dead -> Still secured server -> Census 72 year lag
* Impact of Wiki on science -> Field experiment, paid editing, one account
* Deception: Debrief? Informed?
* Indigenous communities -> Different epistemologies and ontologies. Communicating benefits + empathy
* Vulnerability and different identities
* Is there a global standard of ethics?
* Research impacting outcomes? Predicting outcomes
* Supervision, authority, power
* Inductive versus deductive
* End user: company versus consumer
* Quantitative versus qualitative
* Positive versus normative
