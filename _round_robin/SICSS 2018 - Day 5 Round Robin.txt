Experiments:


Kinds of experiments: 
* manipulating perceptions of company complexity, doing both lab studies with undergraduates (not very motivated, WEIRD (western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) biases and MTurk participants, challenges of generalizing beyond the lab
* Stress responses from ecosystem changes, manipulating proportion of fish in a tank, proportion, density, or presence
* Evaluating a drop-out prevention programs, treatments are after-school activities, measures are educational attainment, ethics of who gets extra programming
* Measuring attitudes to pre-planned burns to prevent wildfires, experimental surveys with varied messages about who benefits or suffers (nature vs. property), framing strategies for persuasion/behavior change, ethics of testing policy change messages
* Measuring personalization of Google search, manipulating political valence of browsing history, comparing search query results controlling for time, location; validity issues of imitating human behavior, trained from Twitter subcommunities posts
* How to find a representative/random sample from population? Dealing with contamination between conditions in the wild; ethics of treatment and benefits
* Encountering A/B tests in the wild: nudges to not use certain tags in WikiData community, Google optimizing for color of links with multi-armed bandits
* Multi-armed bandits for exploration-exploitation of payoffs/benefits under multiple conditions
