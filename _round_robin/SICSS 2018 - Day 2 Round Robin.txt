Digital Trace Data:
Benefits:
* Real time, generated across contexts, easy(ish) access, faster to retrieve
* Comprehensive, no “Hawthorne Effect” -> Greater fidelity, no self-reporting biases
* Always on, time-sensitive
* Large-scale data for high-powered estimates
* Well documented APIs
* Population versus sampling
* Ecological validity -> very naturalistic compared to lab experiemnts
* Can conduct digital experiments


Problems:
* Low civic engagement, biases in skills
* Messy and hard to clean
* Algorithmic contamination / influence / confounding
* Missing data, not knowing what’s missing
* Sparsity of data -> always want more!
* Doesn’t solve causality


Ethics:
* Possibility of hacking
* What users know they’re sharing versus what’s being collected
* Responsibility of platform to explain TOS -> no incentive to write clear TOS
