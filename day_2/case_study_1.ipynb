    "This morning we learned about how to srape data from the web using Python's packages `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. Some of you have already had experience with web scraping, but for others, this may have been your first time collecting digital trace data. This group exercise is designed to find a balance between practicing rudimentary skills (for those of you with little or no experience in this area) to cutting edge techniques (for those of you with extensive expertise in this area). As an added bonus, this exercise not only challenges you to practice your coding skills, but to think about how to ask questions that contribute new knowledge to sociological theory as well.\n",

You need not take the steps above in chronological order. However, after 1 hour you should be prepared to give a 5 minute presentation of your activities. Remember that these daily exercises are a way for you to explore new possible topics and to get to know each other better."
