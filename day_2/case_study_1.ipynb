    "This morning we learned about how to srape data from the web using Python's packages `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. Some of you have already had experience with web scraping, but for others, this may have been your first time collecting digital trace data. This group exercise is designed to find a balance between practicing rudimentary skills (for those of you with little or no experience in this area) to cutting edge techniques (for those of you with extensive expertise in this area). As an added bonus, this exercise not only challenges you to practice your coding skills, but to think about how to ask questions that contribute new knowledge to sociological theory as well.\n",

    "<li>First, independently brainstorm one or two research questions that you believe can be answered using online data sources and web scraping. </li>\n",
    "<li>Divide yourselves into groups of three or four. Try to join a group with people you haven't worked with.</li>\n",
    "<li>For 10 minutes, work together to identify a research question based on one of the data sources proposed by your group members.</li>\n",
    "<li>Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the data you plan to collect.</li>\n",
    "<li>Outline a hybrid research design (e.g. an app or a bot) that could be used to address the weaknesses of the data you collected, or otherwise improve your ability to answer the research question.</li>\n",
    "<li>(If you have time, write code to collect data from each unit of analysis in your sample. See the code below for help.)</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one requirement: the group member with the least amount of experience coding should be responsible for typing the code into a computer. After 45 minutes, we will share our work with the group. Let us know if you'd like to present your group's potential project. Remember that these daily exercises are a way for you to explore new possible topics and to get to know each other better."
